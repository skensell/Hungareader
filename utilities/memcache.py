Notes about memcache:
    Student_by_id is called on every request.
    StoryParent_key is called very frequently too behind the scenes.
    This decorator could be improved if instead of reading and updating, sometimes we
    used the known value to update it.  Then we save db reads.
    Or it would make sense to just update queries when they're actually used.

class memcached(object):
    """
    This is a decorator for storing query results in memcache. 
    It introduces two new keyword arguments 'memcache_key' and 'update' to the function
    which it wraps. The function should specify memcache_key when called if you'd like to
    use a different key than the one defined at instantiation.
    
    @memcached(memcache_key='some_query')
    def q(**kw):
        return [s for s in Story.all().run()]
    
    r = q(memcache_key='my_favorite_key', **kw)
    
    Each time a new key is given to q it hits the datastore, stores it in memcache, and returns it.
    Each time an old key is given it hits the memcache and returns it, unless update=True, in which
    case it hits the datastore, stores it in memcache, and returns it.
    If q is called with no "key" argument, the default key of "some_query" will be used.
    
    @memcached() can also be called without any arguments, providing a default key of DEFAULT_KEY
    but this is not recommended.
